# FloodDetection
“Sensor for rise is Water Level for Flood Indication” is an simple system which keeps close watch over the water level to predict a flood and send emergency notification, so we can embrace ourselves forcaution, to minimize the damage caused by the flood.
The system has WIFI connectivity, thus its collected data can be accessed from anywhere quite easily using IoT.
A solution to this problem is making use of the advanced IoT available in this world. The IoT
device we have in mind are sensors. we decided to place sensors at certain positions above the
river bank and when it reaches a threshold height it will set off an alarm and send SMS
messages to everyone around the area to which the sensor is registered.
